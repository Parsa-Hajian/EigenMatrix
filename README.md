# Finding the Eigen Matrix, Eigan Values and Determinant of a 3x3 Matrix
Finding Eigen Matrix, Eigen Values and Determinant of a Matrix.
# Eigen Values
The eigenvalues of matrix are scalars by which some vectors (eigenvectors) change when the matrix (transformation) is applied to it.

We assume having two matrices with random integer numbers from 0 to 10.
Matrix A 3x3
Matrix B 3x3
Matrix C = (Matrix A) x (Matrix B)

Our Goal is to find the Eigen matrix of C and its eigen values too.
